this is my official e portfolio at the moment. im pretty proud of how its coming along. im not done yet but this will be what i send to recruiters

what i learned-
ive never made a site that sends the emails to me and i have that function functioning just peachy i had to link some free site "emailjs" to the site and it should impress them


pros-



cons-
i used my favorite color as one of the main colors of the site, my family is saying its a good color palet but something about it is a little off in my opinion (even though its my favorite color). i still think itll catch their eye
