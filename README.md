this is my official e portfolio at the moment. im pretty proud of how its coming along. im not done yet but this will be what i send to recruiters

what i learned-
ive never made a site that sends the emails to me and i have that function functioning just peachy i had to link some free site "emailjs" to the site and it should impress them


  pros-

- well, its an eye catcher forsure

-THE STYLING. the colors (light and dark mode) have a nice appeal.  the transition of project descriptions appearing from the bottom, the contact page coming together like an elevator door closing, 

- showcases some pretty impressive skills and creativity. you could know all there is about coding but if you dont use it right whats the use

- i made about 8 links and buttons go to the 'contact' page. no excuse to not find it


  cons-

-i used my favorite color as one of the main colors of the site, my family is saying its a good color palet but something about it is a little off in my opinion (even though its my favorite color). i still think itll catch their eye

-i dont want to be the guy who adds a million animations and gets nothing done but in the context of this SNATCHING recruiters attention i think it does a quite nice job of that. 


  WHAT I LEARNED THROUGH THIS PROJECT-

- making the whole site function instead of just being a digital business card, by that i mean when you fill out the form in the contact section it emails me directly through this site called "emailJS" 

-the funky little shapes and their movement. never seen or heard of it before but i saw a video and loved the idea.  kinda bothered me how he didnt show me how to do it fully, heres the main problems he left unanswered 
    > the rotation of the shapes (sent me down a stack overflow/AI rabbit hole trying to figure it out).
    > the colors of the shapes i found, i just put a filter on them and another for the dark mode. that was completely me and            my creative juices flowing with the grey on purple and the brown going on the grey.
    > making it not go over every element, ( i had to make the footer "position: relative" for whatever reason. on top of                making almost every elements z index higher ).
    > he only put the shapes element on one section. so in the project section the shapes are kinda just suspended there.
    
-i accidentally made the little mail button spin then fade instead of spinning while fading. i actually loved the look. kinda like the old school XBOX's logo. idk its the little stuff. also take a look ath the border of that button.

- took me a little bit to understand the dark mode color inverter, but i think i got it nice on this site. which means i gotta touch up a couple older projects

- this isnt quite part of the project but, making live links on git hub, i didnt know that was a thing i thought once i post it people can just look at my stuff. why did nobody tell me this, i sent my friend the link and he liked it till he tried to click on a project and it went to my profile and he couldnt see it.  i didnt know why, what, or even how to look up a question to solve this problem. long story short, it was an embarrassing headache that took hours to solve.
